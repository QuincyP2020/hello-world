# hello-world
# my first git-hub repository
# I first learned to program basic in 1983 for about 3 months and boy did i love it. My parents lacked the resources to keep me involved in programming.  Who knows what my life would have looked like had i been able to continue learning this skill.  Fast forward 37 years and I'm retired from my first career yet begining again in programming.
